I queried, in various ways, about British battlecruisers in the intra-war period.  I was trying to find some data
that investigated how British battlecruisers were used to further the argument for a powerful surface
fleet while some models were being re-purposed as aircraft carriers.  I struggled to find the right criteria
and I never really did.  I was able to produce a CSV file with a list of ships but they were tied to some catasprophic
explosion I could not identify.

I updated the "also known as" section of HMS Furious to include her nickname of Spurious.
She was given this nickname because the purpose of her design and construction were a pipedream of Admiral Fisher,
his Baltic scheme, for WWI.  After this plan fell apart, she had no purpose but was built anyway.
Ironically, she is the only pre-war aircraft carrier to survive WWII.
