I queried, in various ways, about British battlecruisers in the intra-war period.  I was trying to find some data
that investigated how British battlecruisers were used to further the argument for a powerful surface
fleet while some models were being re-purposed as aircraft carriers.  I struggled to find the right criteria
and I never really did.  I was able to produce a CSV file with a list of ships but they were tied to some catasprophic
explosion I could not identify.

I also did not understand how I came to those results.  Using the query function I included British battle cruisers and a date range
corresponding to the intra-war period where the rest of my data falls.  The CSV list of battle cruisers that was tied to this explosion
was outside the date range I had put in as the criteria, but was also the only result returned that included British battle cruisers.
The explosion was an event I was not familiar with but I also did not try and track it down.  It seemed superfluous to me (and
a query error) becasue I could not think of one event that tied so many British battle cruisers together that I did not know about.
I suppose that is a little arrogant but that is what I was thinking and why I considered the results an error.

What I settled on was the Courageous class battle cruisers which were converted into aircraft carriers after WW1.  Each was designed to fulfill
a goal of the head of the British Royal Navy, Admiral Jackie Fisher, who wanted a fleet of shallow-draft vessels to penetrate the Baltic Sea
and land an invasion force in Germany that could advance to Berlin and end the war.  HMS Courageous and HMS Glorious were commissioned as
battle cruisers and saw some action before the end of the war.  Their half-sister ship, HMS Furious, was completed with only half of her
armanent and a large flying-off platform on the bow.  HMS Furious participated in a raid on German Zeppelin hangars along the Channel coast
but that is about it.  All three were fully converted to aircraft carriers in the 1920s.  

HMS Courageous was sunk barely three weeks into the war by a German U-boat.  HMS Glorious lasted nine months longer but she was sunk
by surface gunfire from the German raiders Scharnhorst and Gniesenau in June of 1940.  The German vessels were modern equivalents to teh battle cruiser
HMS Glorious used to be.  The carrier was escorted by two destroyers, HMS Ardent and HMS Acasta, which were also sunk but not before
HMS Acasta put a torpedo into the Scharnhorst which forced her to return to port.

HMS Furious particiapted in several operations before being relegated to a training ship in 1944.

The strange mission whcih these ships were constructed for, the various re-designs before they reached their final form, and their short
operational careers (except HMS Furious) created the nicknames which they have been stuck with:

HMS Courageous - HMS Outrageous
HMS Glorious - HMS Curious
HMS Furious - HMS Spurious

I updated the "also known as" section of HMS Furious to include her nickname of Spurious. in Wikipedia.
