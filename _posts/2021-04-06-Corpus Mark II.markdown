Proceedings is the professional journal of the US Navy and is published by the US Naval Institute.  It is the repository for professional discussion from officer and enlisted perspectives
and is wide ranging over a host of domestic and international security concerns in the maritime realm.  If a researcher is looking at how the US viewed themes involved with naval planning,
construction, and combat and what the US knew about international maritime subjects this is a good place to start.

**Corpus Discussion July 1925**

The July 1925 issue provides two important data points.  The first is an article discussing the organizational design of a future US fleet
and the second is the Professional Notes section which detail global naval concerns.  One aspect springing from the Professional Notes
section was an analysis of fleet speeds and gun range between the American and British fleets.

**Corpus Discussion August 1925**

The August 1925 supplies a lengthy article on National Strategy from the US perspective.  The Professional Notes section again provides
a global perspective for naval discussion.

**Corpus Discussion Septemeber 1925**

The Septemeber 1925 includes a short articel on the largest ship to pass the Panama Canal in 1925.  This vessel was the HMS Hood, a British battlecruiser and the largest warship at that time.
This discussion is interesting as the American design philosophy leading up to WWII was to not design a ship larger than the width of the Panama Canal locks, 108 feet.  The professional Notes
section again provides data from an international perspective.

**Corpus Discussion October 1925**

The October 1925 issues provides several articles.  The first is written by the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Eberle, and discusses the future of the Navy.  This is interesting in that it gives
professional guidance from the head of the service tot he entire Navy.  As Proceedings is aprofessional journal the majority of the readers are professional officers but it is widely available to all
ranks.  A second article is a short discussion of the treaty navies which were the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.  Again, the Professional Notes section is included for its wide-ranging topics.

**Corpus Discussion November 1925**

The Novemeber 1925 possesses an important article detailing post treaty design theories.  The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was followed by the 1930 London naval Treaty extending many of the limitations on
navasl construction agreed upon in 1922.  It is interesting that only three years after a restrivie naval treaty, US professional thought included discussions of what to do after the treaty expired - almost as
if the US was not expecting the treaty to be extended.  As standard, the Professional Notes section is included for a wider perspective.

**Corpus Discussion December 1925**

December brings a discussion of naval staff operations while the fleet is at sea.  Some intitial discussion of how the staff would operate afloat is important due to the way the US Navy operated in WWII with
many months spent at sea while conducting operations.  The revolving fleet command technique that the US employed meant one staff element afloat would coordinate current operations while a sister staff element ashore
would conduct planning for the next large operation.  As always, the Professional Notes section is included for a more comprehensive take on global naval issues.  The December issue shows a larger amount of content
in this section than previously.

**Word Association Exercise**

One of the most consistently useful tool this class has shown me is Voyant.  The information I have been able to derive so far is relatively unsophisticated and consists mainly of most mentioned terms.  This is somewhat problematic
as many naval vessel terms can be written a variety of ways and frequently include two terms such as aircraft carrier, battle ship, battle cruiser, etc.  For this exercise, I took each separate article and washed them through
Voyant with a main object to discover the most mentioned ship class.  I was expecting to find battleship, battlecruiser, and aircraft carriers as being the most mentioned terms due to the period in naval desing and construction.
The most consistent ship class mentioned, however, was the cruiser class.  As a middle weight, universal ship class I suppose I should have expected that, especially with the ten year hiatus in battleship
construction mandated by teh Washington Naval Treaty.  As the next largest ship type, cruisers became an important negotiating tool.

**Notes to Semester progress**

A large portion of progress on this project has come late in the semester.  If anyone follows these links they will quickly discern that I have completed zero cleaning of these docuements.  I don't understand the process 
and have been unwilling to devote the time to learn.  On one hand, I can read the text as is and I can ignore the junk in the way.  On the other hand, I struggle with the idea that anything
can be computed in this manner.  I try really hard to not be the oldtimer who can not assimilate knew technology and methods but I can clean faster by hand than I can with Regular Expressions
and it appears to be just extra work to discover the right way to do it.  I try to learn new tricks but apparently this old dog is not as progressive as I thought.

By dividing the corpus that I have into smaller and smaller chunks, I have been able to identify a great deal more data that is useful.  Several of the above listed articles include tables that
can be easily made into CSV files for more detailed analysis.  My lack of ability in Regular Expression has nullified some of this new information.  I remain concentrated on what I have been able to produce
and not seek new information.

The website has been a constant issue.  I have been able to progress to a certain level but not beyond.  zi would prefer to present my data in a more visual way but to no avail as yet.  Naval history provides many
opportuntities for sweeping images that illustrate the majesty of the sea and the enormity of naval vessels but they remain a mystery to the viewers of my site as of yet.
