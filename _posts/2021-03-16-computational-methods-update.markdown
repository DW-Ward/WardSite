I think I might be finally figuring this out.

This opinion stems from my work through the Computational Historian tutorial about creating a Jekyll website.
I got somewhat confused as I started using my own dta and then realized this would not produce
the desired outcome according to the tutorial.  I then shifted to exactly what the tutorial said which got me far enough to utter
the above statement.

There was a significant detour on the Hugo website information.  I think somewhere in the Jekyll
guide I hit a snag, became frustrated, and switched to the Hugo guide.  I was following this guide failry well
but I hit a pay wall to publish the site.  I was not sure that was intended for the class so I backed up and looked for 
other guides and tutorials for Hugo sites.  After following several of these I felt confident that
I was ont he right track and was on the verge of producing a website I  enjoyed.  That was when
 I encountered the error message stating roughly "if you received this error message there is an undiagnosed fault, please contact the publisher"
 which is where I said goodbye to Hugo.
