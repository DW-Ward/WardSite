I have sub-divided my text files from the original into six smaller entries.
Each entry represents one issue of Proceedings in 1925 from July to December.
I am working on pulling relevant articles from each issue as well.  Also included
are the CSV files for my visualization of Fleet Speed comparisons.
These are all in the repository and I am working on linking them to the website.

The overall intent is to show how the major naval powers went from this:

![HMS Dreadnought](/users/grimd/WardSite/_site/assets/Images/dreadnought1.jfif)

to this:

![American carrier fleet 1944](/users/grimd/WardSite/_site/assets/Images/CV.jfif)
