**Word Association Exercise**

One of the most consistently useful tool this class has shown me is Voyant.  The information I have been able to derive so far is relatively unsophisticated and consists mainly of most mentioned terms.  This is somewhat problematic
as many naval vessel terms can be written a variety of ways and frequently include two terms such as aircraft carrier, battleship, battle cruiser, etc.  For this exercise, I took each separate article and washed them through
Voyant with a main object to discover the most mentioned ship class.  I was expecting to find battleship, battlecruiser, and aircraft carriers as being the most mentioned terms due to the period in naval design and construction.
The most consistent ship class mentioned, however, was the cruiser class.  As a middle weight, universal ship class I suppose I should have expected that, especially with the ten-year hiatus in battleship
construction mandated by teh Washington Naval Treaty.  As the next largest ship type, cruisers became an important negotiating tool.

While it is not reflected in this data, the discussion of the cruiser as a vessel class began of increasing importance.  Cruisers were generally classified into two categories.  A
heavy cruiser was defined as a vessel 10,000 tons or lower with a gun caliber above 6.1" but no greater than 8".  A light cruiser was a vessel no greater than 10,000 tons bt with a gun caliber
6" or lower.  The Japanese and the United States were building large, heavy cruisers to operate in the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean while the British needed a large number of smaller cruisers
to protect trade routes rather than a few large cruisers to project power.  At first, there was little to no limitations on the total tonnage that could be devoted to cruiser construction - the early treaties
focused on capital ships.  Later, cruiser construction came to be recognized as just another level of naval competition the treaties were trying to limit and total tonnage ceilings were negotiated.  The difference
in design philosophy made it appear that Britain was keeping pace or even leading in cruiser construction but her ships were individually less capable than that of her neighbors
and this came to be reflected in wartime performance.
