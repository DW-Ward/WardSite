**Visualization**

The treaties which were such a large portion of the intra-war period played havoc with the fleets of the major powers and directly impacted the how those fleets would be constituted int he future.
Many of the larger vessels were scrapped or placed in reserve and new construction of capital ships was placed on hold.  The fleets which would be most relevant in the Pacific War to come include the American, British, and Japanese
fleets.  In 1925 war was not on the immediate horizon but planning for it was almost constant.  In a naval war, counting of vessels and the capabilities of these vessels were of prime concern.  A comparison in 1925
illustrates that Britain remained the premier naval power if one only looked at numbers.  What is not reflected, however, is the capabilities of these ships.  The numbers for aircraft carriers are not reflective of later trends as this
was the beginning of the naval aviation era.  The number of capital ships is a little more instructive, but these reflect numbers and capabilities little removed from the technologies used in World War One.
What is not reflected in these numbers is the modernization efforts, specifically of Japan, which was well on her way to modernizing half of her capital ships which made them much more capable than the numbers might imply,
especially when compared against the un-modernized vessels of America and Britain.

The cruiser numbers are much more interesting and reflect what we have learned through simple word association through Voyant.  Cruiser discussions were a key element in the capital ship building
holiday of the 1920s and reflect the different design philosophies of these three countries.  America and Japan were building cruisers of a similar design which were individually larger and more capable but overall of lesser numbers.
Britain needed larger numbers of these vessels but were individually less capable.  The bare numbers indicate Britain possessed a huge advantage in this vessel class but this does not tell the whole story.
